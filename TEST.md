## Download
Please go to [releases page](https://github.com/SamuelTulach/VirusTotalUploader/releases) to download compiled app and installer. *It would also be nice if you starred this repo.*

## How to get API key
It is really simple! All you need to do is to go to [VirusTotal official page](https://www.virustotal.com/), create profile and copy your key.
